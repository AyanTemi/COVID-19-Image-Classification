# COVID-19-Image-Classification

# Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruptions in healthcare systems worldwide. One of the key challenges in controlling the spread of the disease is early detection and accurate diagnosis of the infected individuals. In this regard, medical imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and CT scans have proven to be effective tools for identifying COVID-19 cases. Machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to provide high accuracy in the classification of chest X-ray and CT images of COVID-19 patients. In this project, we aim to develop a CNN model for the classification of COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images.

# Objectives
The main objective of this project is to develop a CNN model for the classification of COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia cases using chest X-ray images. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Collect a dataset of chest X-ray images of COVID-19, normal, and viral pneumonia cases from kaggle.
- Preprocess the image dataset by resizing and normalizing the images.
- Develop a CNN model architecture suitable for the classification of chest X-ray images.
- Train and evaluate the performance of the model on the dataset.
- Analyze the performance of the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provide insights and recommendations for future improvements in the model.
